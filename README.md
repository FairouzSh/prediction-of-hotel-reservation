The report elaborated on how to build a predictive model for predicting customer booking cancellations in hotels. 
In the hospitality industry, it's crucial to have an understanding of the customer's booking behavior, as it helps 
hotels plan and allocate resources effectively.
The main purpose was to optimize each model by adjusting the hyperparameters.
